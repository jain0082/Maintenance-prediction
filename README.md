# Maintenance-prediction

This project is about exploring predictive maintenance of machines.
Predictive maintenance is extremely important as every organization runs into machine failures and being able to aptly predict when a particular machine would fail can help prevent its breakdown. 

I have tried to run various classification algorithms to compare their functioning and test the best predictive model for this dataset.

Based on historical lifetime years, pressure index, moisture and temperature index by a particular provider and used by a particular team, I am trying to predict whether the machine will break or not (binary output variable).
